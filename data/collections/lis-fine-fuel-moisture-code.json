    "description": "The Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) is a component of the Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System. It is a numeric rating of the moisture content of litter and other cured fine fuels such as leaves, twigs, and needles. The FFMC values increases as the moisture content decreases, meaning the higher the FFMC, the drier the fine fuels are and the higher the potential for fire spread. This code is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and the flammability of fine fuels. It is a good indicator of the potential for fire to start and spread quickly, as dry fine fuels can ignite easily and burn rapidly. The FFMC is often used in conjunction with the Initial Spread Index (ISI) to determine the expected rate of fire spread.",
