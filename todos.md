# TODOs

## Immediate

* Add opacities
* Fix location of indicator
* Talking points on datasets (...titiler api, wmts, ogc features, geojson)
  - datasets from different sensors, pulled from
  - lvis and uavsar COGS from API in MAAP, wmts
  - imerg dayling and monthly from covid API using timelapse and xyz
  - point clouds from features service, geojson response (atl08 peru)
  - static geojson (atl08 afrisar)


## Longer term
* mosaic json for lvis (right now using wmts API from MAAP API, I can't even recall how I'm doing this...)
* gamma/gradients for datasets don't really have knowledge of best way to do this
* api for timelapse
* troubleshoot atl08 OGC endpoint for collections geojson for afrisar
* tiling of atl08 data, geojson is too big...
